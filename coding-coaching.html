              Working with Jared has really helped me learn to code. The
              flexibility of his program is a huge benefit as he keeps you
              moving forward without feeling pressured to move on before you
              have a good grasp of things. Another thing I really appreciate
              about Jared is that he’s always available to help with concepts or
              even specific debugging or coding problems. It is a huge asset
              when learning to have someone you can contact and ask specific
              questions and you know they’ll get back to you within a few hours
              at most. The layout and pace of the program is very good but the
              availability is incredibly beneficial and valuable. I know I
              wouldn’t be where I am on my programming journey without the help
              Jared has provided.

              Enrolling into Jared’s program is the best investment I have made
              so far. I always wanted to switch my career to technology, but I
              just really didn’t know where to start, and Jared gave me a very
              clear path that has worked out perfectly while I am still able to
              maintain my full time job. Even after only a couple weeks into the
              program I already saw the difference in my coding skill. With his
              knowledge, support and passion in teaching, I do believe I will
              achieve my goal very fast and I would love to recommend Jared to
              anyone who is seeking a technology career.

              Jared is great. I was in doubt if I should start this new career
              path but he was so helpful and was able to answer all my
              questions. I’m enjoying working with him and he is very
              encouraging. Would highly recommend him to everyone!

              Meeting Jared was nothing less than a miracle for me! I was
              stumped for months, and he went above and beyond to help. What
              started off as an introductory meeting turned out to be the sign I
              had been asking for as a beginner, that I was on the right track
              and to not give up! He was informative, inquisitive, and so
              patient with me while I tried to explain to him my situation. I
              loved working with Jared and definitely recommend you do too.
