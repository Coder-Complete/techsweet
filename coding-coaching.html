                    Working with Jared has really helped me learn to code. The
                    flexibility of his program is a huge benefit as he keeps you
                    moving forward without feeling pressured to move on before
                    you have a good grasp of things. Another thing I really
                    appreciate about Jared is that he’s always available to help
                    with concepts or even specific debugging or coding problems.
                    It is a huge asset when learning to have someone you can
                    contact and ask specific questions and you know they’ll get
                    back to you within a few hours at most. The layout and pace
                    of the program is very good but the availability is
                    incredibly beneficial and valuable. I know I wouldn’t be
                    where I am on my programming journey without the help Jared
                    has provided.

                    Enrolling into Jared’s program is the best investment I have
                    made so far. I always wanted to switch my career to
                    technology, but I just really didn’t know where to start,
                    and Jared gave me a very clear path that has worked out
                    perfectly while I am still able to maintain my full time
                    job. Even after only a couple weeks into the program I
                    already saw the difference in my coding skill. With his
                    knowledge, support and passion in teaching, I do believe I
                    will achieve my goal very fast and I would love to recommend
                    Jared to anyone who is seeking a technology career.

                    Jared is great. I was in doubt if I should start this new

                    What started off as an introductory meeting turned out to be

                    the right track and to not give up! He was informative,
                    inquisitive, and so patient with me while I tried to explain
                    to him my situation. I loved working with Jared and
                    definitely recommend you do too.

              Jared has always put deep thought into the many life paths that
              one can take. His own journey of self-discovery can parallel
              almost anyone’s experience of struggling to get where they want to
              go.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Always having an affinity for scientific topics, Jared decided to
              study mechanical engineering at McGill University in Montreal,
              Canada. Not excited by the mechanical engineer’s career path,
              Jared decided to embark on a year and a half of world travel and
              self-discovery.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              At the culmination of his trip, he realized that learning to code
              would provide him all the opportunity he was looking for.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Jared spent 3 months learning on his own, followed by a 13-week
              bootcamp in NYC to accelerate his learning. He then spent 4
              stressful months looking for a job, finally securing a
              6-figure-paying position at a healthcare company in Seattle.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              He worked hard in the industry for a number of years and had the
              good fortune to work closely with accomplished ex-employees of big
              tech companies and founders of successful startups.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When he was ready to be an entrepreneur, Jared left the workforce
              and launched a coding program designed to help people along the
              same path he took, but without all the stress.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              He believes it is essential for people to be supported through the
              entire journey of learning coding until they've landed happily
              into the industry.
